# Store test API
Implement an API, that support basic inventory actions. To calculate your inventory throughout time, you'll use the FIFO (First in, First out) principle

# Install modules:
npm i

cd front

npm i

//I'm not front-end developer so I put frontend part in my project

# Test
npm run swagger-test

# Description

I used Node.js, Express.js, swagger and MongoDB to do this task.

Tests were automatic generated by swagger tool.

Response function was changed (res._end) to unify all responses

You can test every API request using this link https://test-store1.herokuapp.com/docs/
